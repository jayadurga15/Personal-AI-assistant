# Personal-AI-assistant
This project is a Streamlit-based web application featuring ZADE, a playful AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The app allows users to interact with ZADE in real time, receiving friendly and informative responses. Styled with custom CSS, it offers a visually engaging chat experience, with purple chat bubbles and a fun heading. Users can ask questions, view conversation history, and reset the chat anytime. To set up, install Streamlit and OpenAI libraries, add your OpenAI API key in the script, and run the app using streamlit run app.py. Customization options include modifying ZADE's behavior and appearance.
