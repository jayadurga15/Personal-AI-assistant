# Personal-AI-assistant
This project is a Streamlit-based web application featuring ZADE, a playful AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The app allows users to interact with ZADE in real time, receiving friendly and informative responses. Styled with custom CSS, it offers a visually engaging chat experience, with purple chat bubbles and a fun heading. Users can ask questions, view conversation history, and reset the chat anytime. To set up, install Streamlit and OpenAI libraries, add your OpenAI API key in the script, and run the app using streamlit run app.py. Customization options include modifying ZADE's behavior and appearance.

1. Real-time chat: Users can ask questions and receive responses from ZADE in a playful and informative manner.

2. Chat history: The app maintains a conversation history that shows all interactions between the user and ZADE.

3. Custom styling: The app has been customized with CSS for a unique, visually appealing design. Chat bubbles are styled in purple tones, and ZADEâ€™s heading is in a playful font.

4. Conversation reset: Users can end the conversation and clear the chat history with the click of a button.
